# Bioacoustics Software Database

The Bioacoustics Software Database is a [website](https://rhine3.github.io/bioacoustics-software/) and associated [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ba1MY4o5Sm1f08IekJcbxAtSjkDN71Z1RZ42kzrofJ0/edit#gid=0) that pulls together current software used in bioacoustics.


A variety of free and paid software is available for bioacoustic analyses. Software packages vary from complete graphical interfaces, to command-line interfaces, to utility libraries that can be used to create analysis pipelines in Python, R, or other programming languages.

Criteria for inclusion in the list are:
* The software is targeted to or widely used by bioacoustics researchers
* The software either is stable, is currently in active development, or was recently released

## Suggestions?
Have a suggestion for software to add to or update in the database? Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/2CyEnTbu7Asm8q2d7) to request updates to the database.

## Disclaimer
This list is not necessarily a recommendation or a guarantee of quality of particular software packages or analysis techniques. 

You should always judge the performance of an analysis method by its performance on *your* dataset. Analysis methods are often published along with metrics to describe their performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, different recording conditions or different distributions of sounds present in your dataset can result in starkly different performance of the same method.
